Hi Daniel,

I'm from India and I have 3.6 years of experience with Accenture Solutions Pvt. Ltd. I have worked as SAP Quality Assurance Analyst and Data Analyst in the recent project for a short time. I'm familiar to core java language and big data hadoop ecosystem concepts. I worked on .Net framework(C# langauge) in my undergraduate program but it's a long time back. :) Moreover, my hobbies include listening music (big fan of Coldplay) and cooking Indian cuisines. I like to share that the way you explained the topics today in the class was great!!
